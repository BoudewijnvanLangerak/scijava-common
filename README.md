SciJava Common is a common library for SciJava software. It provides a
plugin framework, with an extensible mechanism for service discovery, backed
by its own annotation processor, so that plugins can be loaded dynamically.
It is used by both [ImageJ](https://github.com/imagej/imagej) and
[SCIFIO](https://github.com/scifio/scifio).
